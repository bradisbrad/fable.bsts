This package provides a tidy R interface to the bsts forecasting procedure using [fable](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable). This package makes use of the [prophet package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bsts) for R.

## Completed

- Static Intercepts ^1^
- Levels (local and shared) ^1^
- Auto-regressive models (auto and user-specified) ^1^
- Trends (local linear, semilocal linear and Student local linear) ^1^
- Regression and Trigonometric seasonality specification ^1^
^1^ _user specification of priors is not yet implemented._

## In Progress

- Holiday specification
- Exogenous Regressor specification
- Monthly-Annual cyclicality for daily data
- User-defined priors
